## Core Product Principle — Dashboard is the Only Interface

**The custom dashboard (`e2e/dashboard/`) is the single interface for ALL operations.**
Non-technical users must be able to do everything from `http://localhost:5173` — no terminal, no CLI.

This applies to:
- Running tests (all products, individual suites, single specs)
- Recording new tests (codegen — opens browser automatically)
- Viewing results and reports
- Managing auth sessions (check status, re-authenticate)
- Anything else added in the future

**Never** suggest the user run `npm run`, `npx playwright`, `go run`, or any shell command
to accomplish a task the dashboard could handle. When building new features, always pair
the backend endpoint with a dashboard UI control in the same change.

## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes � gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review � token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
